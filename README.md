# FactorAnalysis_NYC_CMSsurvey
In 2020, NYC DOT conducted a panel survey of respondents who completed the 2019 CMS. The three surveys allowed the agency to better understand how residents traveled and used public spaces during the stay-at-home period and reopening phases of the pandemic. This is the first panel survey that was fielded from May 4 â€“ May 8, 2020.

In this project, I will try to group a few variables with common theme into factors that can be used to find an index-value of the scope of the grouped factors.
